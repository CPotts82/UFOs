# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a user-friendly, interactive web application to filter and display recent (2010) UFO sighting information from a large dataset. Using JavaScript and Bootstrap, an aesthetically pleasing and easy to use web application make filtering for unique UFO data interesting and entertaining. 
## Resources
JavaScript, D3 library, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, 
## Results
  ### How-to-Use web app
    - Clear data filters by clicking the "UFO Sightings" phrase in upper left hand corner of page.
    - Under "Filter Search" where the input boxes are: put an appropriate search phrase in all of the boxes, one of the boxes,  none of the boxes or anywhere in between.  Whatever is placed in the input box(es) will be searched and the corresponding data will be returned in the table area upon pushing the 'Enter' button on the keyboard. For example: if I want to just search the UFO sightings for Texas, I will simply type "tx" in the "state" input box and press the 'Enter' button on my keyboard.  The sightings for the state of Texas will be returned in the table area. Please see image below:

## Summary
  ### Drawback
    - limited data - This dataset is only from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. Expand this set to include 10 years or more of data so trends can be spotted. 
    - not displayed visually  - the interactive table is really nice and super easy to use, but the data is not displayed in a visually appealing way. Sure, true researchers will not mind reading the small print that returns their search criteria but others may not want so spend that time sifting through the data.  
  ### Recommendations
    - add more data. Years worth of data. Add filter so you can filter by year.
    - Add interactive charts so that filtered data can be displayed visually. (Maybe a bubble chart that shows frequency of visits. Bar charts and histograms show frequency as will.  Bubble charts to illustrate visits per state.  Bar charts for cities?
